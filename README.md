# SICR_BCI
Tensorflow implementation of "Mutual Information-driven Subject-invariant and Class-relevant Deep Representation Learning in BCI"

* Programming Language : Python3
* Contact : E.-J. Jeon (eunjinjeon@korea.ac.kr)
* Function : We provide a deep neural network for subject-invariant and class-disentangled learning for motor imager-based brain-computer interface. This framework maximizes mutual information between different subjects and minimizes mutual information between class-relevant and class-irrlevant features.
