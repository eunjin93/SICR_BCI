* Accepted to _IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems_ (2021, DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3100583)
* Function : We propose a novel deep-learning framework that learns subject-invariant and class-relevant feature representations in an information-theoretic and end-to-end manner. Our proposed components of feature decomposition and feature enrichment can be naturally plugged into the existing netowrk arhictectures.
