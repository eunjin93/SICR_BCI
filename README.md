# Mutual Information-driven Subject-invariant and Class-relevant Deep Representation Learning in BCI
This repository provides the official Pytorch implementation of "Jeon _et al._, Mutual Information-driven Subject-invariant and Class-relevant Deep Representation Learning in BCI, _IEEE-TNNLS_, 2021 (DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3100583)." 
* Contact : E.-J. Jeon (eunjinjeon@korea.ac.kr)
* We propose a novel deep learning framework that learns subject-invariant and class-relevant feature representations in an information-theoretic and end-to-end manner. Our proposed components of feature decomposition and feature enrichment can be naturally plugged into the existing network architectures.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.4.0+
