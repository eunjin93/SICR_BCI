# Mutual Information-driven Subject-invariant and Class-relevant Deep Representation Learning in BCI

* Python 3, pytorch 1.4.0
* Contact : E.-J. Jeon (eunjinjeon@korea.ac.kr)
* Function : We propose a novel deep-learning framework that learns subject-invariant and class-relevant feature representations in an information-theoretic and end-to-end manner. Our proposed components of feature decomposition and feature enrichment can be naturally plugged into the existing netowrk arhictectures.
